    "\n",
    "__Normality__ \n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals (differences between the observed and predicted values) should be normally distributed. If this assumption is violated, it could impact the validity of the results by increasing the likelihood of Type I or Type II errors.\n",

    "while the Within Groups Variance represents the amount of variation that cannot be explained by the differences between groups and is instead due to random error or other unmeasured factors.\n",
